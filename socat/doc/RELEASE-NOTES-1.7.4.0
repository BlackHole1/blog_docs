Socat 1.7.4.0 Release Notes

For a list of fixes and new features see file CHANGES.


Incompatible change:

Address UDP-DATAGRAM:<address>:<remoteport>,bind=<localport>:
Up to 1.7.3.4 it ignored incoming packets that did not come from <remoteport>.
Therefore it was useless for protocols like SSDP.
With 1.7.4.0 this address does not check the source port of incoming packets.
Use option sourceport=<remoteport> to keep the old behaviour.


Features based on deprecated APIs:

The openssl-method option is obsolete, use openssl-min-proto-version and
openssl-max-proto-version instead. If you need it nevertheless run configure
with --enable-openssl-method

The res-aaonly and res-primary resolver options are deprecated. Enable them with
configure option --enable-res-deprecated


Old Linux kernel and glibc:

Socat now uses pselect() instead of select() when receiving incoming packets
with UDP-RECVFROM. However, it turns out that, in particular io Debian-4 (Etch),
the old method worked more reliable than the pselect() simulation of glibc.
If this problem seems to affect you run configure, edit the generated config.h
ile, outcomment the HAVE_PSELECT line, then run make.


Nonlocal tests:

The SNI feature can be tested against the badssl.com test web server. When you
want to enable these tests use option -foreign:
./test.sh -foreign OPENSSL_SNI OPENSSL_NO_SNI
